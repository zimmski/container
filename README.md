Go comes currently only with a few types of data structures. I want to change this disadvantage with this repository. (Besides learning some new things of course.) As I'm doing this in my spare time I do not expect on finishing this project anytime soon.

You can find a list of data structures I want to implement on Wikipedia's excellent [List of data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) article.
